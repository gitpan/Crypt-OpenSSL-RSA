        - Workaround for gcc 3.2 compile problems:
          "/usr/include/openssl/des.h:193: parse error before '&' token"
          (Patch by Rob Brown <bbb@cpan.org>)
        - Deprecate no-arg constructor, load_*_key methods and the
          instance method generate_key; switch to three constructors:
          new_public_key, new_private_key and generate_key (as a class
          method)
        - Deprecate set_padding_mode method; replace with
          use_xxx_padding.
        - move tests into t directory, use Test as a framework

        - Fix two bugs reported by Gordon Lack <gml4410@ggr.co.uk>: use

          left-hand, value when doing an assignment from an SV to an HV

        - Fix bug reported by Charles Jardine <cj10@cam.ac.uk>: use

	- Incorporating patch from Matthias Bauer
	  <bauerm@immd1.informatik.uni-erlangen.de>, which provides
	  signing and verification, as well as uses OpenSSL's internal
	  error reporting system.  This patch also fixes a bug with the
	  RSA_NO_PADDING_MODE.  Thanks, Matthias!
	- Deprecate set_padding_mode in favor of use_xxx_padding.
	- Rather than returning true on success, false on failure, just
	  croak when there are problems.
	- Plug memory leaks.
	- Fix my email address (it's cpan.org, not cpan.com)
