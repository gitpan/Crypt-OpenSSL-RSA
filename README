Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA is an XS perl module designed to provide basic RSA
functionality.  It does this by providing a glue to the RSA functions
in the openSSL library.  In particular, it provides the following functions:

       loadPublicKey, loadPrivateKey - load a key from a string
       getPublicKeyString, getPrivateKeyString - save a key to a string
       generateKey - make a new key
       encypt, decrypt, sign_verify
       use_pkcs1_oaep_padding, use_pkcs1_padding,
       use_sslv23_padding, use_no_padding
       use_md5_hash, use_sha1_hash, use_ripemd160_hash
       size -  Returns the size, in bytes, of the key.
       checkKey - checks the validity of a key.

Bugs:
  There is a small memory leak when generating new keys of more than 512 bits.

  The openssl functions RSA_public_decrypt, RSA_private_decrypt are
  not yet implemented.

  There is no support for encrypting text larger than the key-size.

  There is no Crypt::CBC support.
